Current Implementation:
I built a basic antivirus scanner using Python's hashlib for SHA-256 hash matching, Tkinter for a simple GUI, and manual signature checks (including EICAR test detection).
The tool scans files/directories by comparing hashes against a predefined malware database and checks for known malicious content patterns, with results displayed in a color-coded interface.

Advanced Alternatives:
For a more robust solution, you could integrate YARA for pattern-based detection, ClamAV for access to millions of signatures, or the VirusTotal API for cloud-powered scans. 
Replace Tkinter with PyQt or a React-based web UI, add multiprocessing for faster scans, and incorporate Cuckoo Sandbox for behavioral analysis. 
These upgrades would enable heuristic detection, real-time monitoring, and enterprise-scale threat analysis while maintaining Python as the core language.
